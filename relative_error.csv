,,,,,,,,Additional notes:
,,,,,,,,More time means more program features to see if I could yeild a better result with other tools.
,,,,,,,," I would try my automeasure algorithm, then if that seemed too timeconsuming then I would resort to threshold mode and getting the largest components and if those would ever fail then I'd hand trace with the features available. "
